Business Associate Portal
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
In the Business Associate Portal, we’ll be able to add, send, and manage all of your agreements. A Business Associate is anyone who may or will come into contact with PHI, like your EHR or IT company, but not a lab or insurance company. The agreement is imperative because it affirms a business associate’s commitment to adhering to the same privacy standards that you, a covered entity, follow when it comes to handling PHI. It also helps protect your practice from fines or liability if a breach or other incident occurs from a business associate.

To add a Business Associate, click the blue plus icon and fill out their information. As for the expiration date, you can click here for no expiration date unless they indicate an expiration date is required. If there is an expiration date, we will notify you when it is time to update. After clicking submit, you’ll see a send icon on the right here. It’ll unlock three ways to complete your agreement: emailing, uploading, or linking a website. We highly recommend the email option as this will send Abyde’s agreement, which has been reviewed and vetted to best protect your practice. It also allows them to sign the agreement within the Abyde software. This will be sent to the email you entered when filling in the vendor information. There are some vendors with their own agreements, so if you click the PDF icon, you will be able to upload one there. Lastly, you can copy the URL or link to an agreement here. 

Once your agreement is uploaded, signed via email, or linked, you’ll see this blue ‘signed’ icon appear instead of the green ‘send’ icon. No matter how your agreement was completed, Abyde will automatically send the Business Associate a copy of your Notice of Privacy Practices, which is a necessary best practice. 

There are two other icons to note: the pencil to edit your vendor information and the trashcan to archive a vendor you’re no longer using. You can also sort your Business Associates by name, email, phone number, or expiration date.

	We deliver training on a yearly basis. When in the training portal, you can watch videos by clicking the play button here. You will then receive your certificate of completion after taking a 10-question quiz by clicking the quiz button here. Remember, you need to score above 70% to pass…the good news is that you have unlimited attempts. You can also view the reporting tab, which shows the training completed, including the number of attempts and the ability to view, download, or print your certificate. Note that if you are a part of multiple locations, you only need to take each training once. We recommend taking your yearly training as soon as it’s available. 

	In your employee portal dashboard, you can see key information like your specific location and HIPAA Compliance Officer, as well as access your HIPAA Training or policies and procedures. If your business has access to an OSHA account, you can click here to switch to that dashboard quickly. As an employee, take advantage of the fact that you can complete HIPAA training or check up on a policy or procedure from any of your devices whenever you want!

+++++++++++policy++++++++++++++++
Traditionally, policies and procedures are kept physically in a binder but here you’ll find every policy, procedure, and form available digitally to download or print. You can click here to do exactly that. Additionally, you can see each document's complete history by clicking here, which reflects when your compliance officer makes changes to answers on your SRA. And if you roll over the information icon on each document, you’ll see pertinent information, such as where it’s generated from and recommendations. We highly suggest you familiarize yourself with your policies as time goes on. 


++++++++++++Breach Log++++++++++++

	If your practice has experienced a data breach you can click the blue plus button here and fill in the Incident Log below. The Incident Log is for internal use only and will not be shared outside of your organization. Be sure to select all forms of PHI that were exposed or possibly exposed in the breach. If ‘other’, please describe the specific type of PHI exposed to the best of your ability. After clicking ‘Submit,’ you’ll be prompted to complete the incident risk assessment. Remember, the sooner you complete the Risk Assessment, the better you will be able to respond and mitigate the risk of your submitted breach and comply with government-mandated notification deadlines. You’ll then proceed to fill out additional information on the breach on a question-by-question basis. After finishing, you’ll be able to make edits by clicking the pencil icon, or download the incident report by clicking ‘download.’ If you decide not to fill out the Risk Assessment, you’ll see a pending icon that you can click on to finish the report. Keep in mind the Incident Log can be used for potential breaches as well, even if you do not plan to report the incident.  

++++++++++++Asset Log ++++++++++++

	The asset log section is for your practice to log all devices that have access to electronic protected health information, or ePHI. Click on the blue plus button and complete the fields below to identify all information around any and all devices, such as computers, storage, devices, servers, phones, etc., that have access to or potentially have access to patient information. After clicking submit, you can click on the pencil icon to edit your device information, or you can click on the trashcan icon to mark an asset as inactive. If preferred, you may import multiple asset log records via Excel file upload. Click the ‘download template file’ text in the pop-up you get when hovering over the ‘import’ button, and then click ‘Import’ to upload your document when you’re ready. Finally, you can click ‘export’ to receive an Excel sheet of your asset log.     

++++++++++++Access Log ++++++++++++

	The Access Log section allows your practice to log Business Associates or individuals who access your software or equipment and are not an employee. To add a log, click the blue plus icon here and fill in the information below. After submitting, you can edit the information by clicking the pencil icon or archive it into your Abyde Drive by clicking the trash can icon. A PDF of the Access Log can be found in your Policies and Procedures Section.


++++++++++score card++++++++++++++
Your Scorecard is your completed Security Risk Analysis but with a few extra perks. At the base level, you can download a complete copy of your SRA by clicking the download button here. However, you can also look at each of your answers on a question-by-question basis. You can see the safeguard covered, your answer, and the associated risk level. If you click on the risk level you can see the likelihood, impact rating, and education or recommendations for any risk labeled medium or above. It’s important to note that there’s never a ‘no risk’ scenario. Even with all the best practices in place, there’s always the potential for error. 

Additionally, you can filter your answers by safeguard or by risk level, and you can click the pencil icon to edit your answer whenever you want. However, don’t feel like you need to come back here and constantly update. The “review by” date in the top right corner will let you know when we’ll send a reminder to your HIPAA Compliance Officer to come by the “ongoing Compliance” module and update the answer there, or you can click the pencil icon and update your answer whenever you want. 

Finally, you can see the history of every risk analysis we’ve ever generated for your account by clicking the “view history” button. The software will take a snapshot of your SRA when answers or profile information are changed. It will also generate and store an SRA at the end of each month. Here, you can see the dates they were created, as well as a quick snapshot of your score and the ability to download right here. 


++++++++training++++++++++++++
	In the reporting tab, you can see each employee's completion status for each training module. The reporting includes the date the training was sent, whether the video and quiz were completed, the number of attempts, and a copy of the certificate you can print or download. You can also click on the ‘Pending’ button to send an email reminder to complete their training in the employee portal, and you can click here to send it to all employees. Finally, you can download a training report for your entire practice by clicking here.

++++++++++++++Recommended Training Tab ++++++++++++++

 In the recommended tab, you can watch each training by clicking the play button here. Since we’re currently in a user account, you can see both the HCO training and your employees' training. As the HCO, you only need to watch the HCO version of each training. You can access each quiz by clicking the ‘Quiz’ button and then choose which employee is taking the quiz. Remember, employees can complete this on their own in their employee portal or here in your account. Once the quiz begins, keep in mind that you need to score above 70% to pass, but you do have unlimited attempts. 


++++++++++++++ongoing compliance+++++++++++++++
 Our Ongoing Compliance module exists to save you from redoing your entire Security Risk Analysis year after year. Here, we prioritize questions based on both the risk level and your “Don’t Know” answers from the SRA, which will help us update your policies and procedures automatically. Eventually, our Ongoing Compliance Module will follow up on all questions from the SRA within 12 months to ensure HIPAA compliance. We recommend including anyone else in the practice who may have more knowledge of the subject, for instance, that might be your IT professional for the technical safeguard questions. Don’t feel like you have to have a concrete answer; you can still answer “Don’t Know” if you're unsure, and they’ll be back in your pool of ongoing compliance questions for next time. Also, we’ll send you notifications for when it’s time to complete your ongoing compliance, so there is no need to randomly log in to see if it’s time.


+++++++++++++++++disaster recovery plan+++++++++++++++
 The Disaster Recovery Plan is important to the practice because it will be used in the event of an emergency or disaster. In the first section, input contact information for local emergency responders to be dynamically generated within your organization’s Disaster Recovery Plan over in your policies and procedures module. Next, list all vendors. Vendors may include companies and individuals who are not considered business associates. Feel free to click ‘not applicable’ if you don’t use a certain type of vendor. After that, designate key emergency roles and responsibilities for employees within your organization. These assignments will also be dynamically generated in your Disaster Recovery Plan. Next, on a scale of 1 to 3 with 1 being not likely, 2 being somewhat likely, and 3 being likely, label what the likelihood of each event affecting your business. Finally, you just have to click yes or no on whether or not your practice has a lab. You can come back and edit any part of your Disaster Recovery Plan by clicking the pencil icon next to the associated area.


+++++++++++++++++employee+++++++++++++
You can add employees who work at this location by clicking on the blue plus icon and completing the required fields below. The email should be unique to each employee because that’s how they’ll access their employee portal. As for using the employee’s personal number, we use it to build your Disaster Recovery plan’s phone tree. No worries, we won’t be reaching out to your employees; this info is just for record-keeping. Before an employee is added, you can automatically send their Employee Onboarding Policy to be signed by clicking on the ‘Send Confidentiality Agreement' button you find here. You can also send it afterward by clicking the ‘Send’ button here and see their status as either pending or signed. Additionally, you can choose to print out a PDF version of the agreement by clicking the PDF icon.  

Next, you’ll want to click on the ‘access’ button. Here, you can specify the parts of the software and network required by each employee to perform their job. By answering yes or no to these questions, we’ll create your Access Authorization Policy and store it in your policies and procedures. 

Lastly, if an employee is no longer with your practice, you can click the trash can icon, and we’ll archive their information in your Abyde Drive. 

+++++++SRA++++++++++++
The Security Risk Analysis is easily one of the most important pieces to your compliance puzzle. Conducting one allows you to find vulnerabilities in three potential areas of your practice: physical, administrative, and technical. Each question in our SRA is linked to one of those three areas. We’ve included relevant laws associated with each question in case you want to do some extra reading. And when it comes to answers, they’re straightforward - you’ll have the options of ‘No, ‘Yes’, or ‘Don’t know’. Don’t feel bad about answering with ‘Don’t know’, it just means it’ll be addressed later in your ongoing compliance module. 

As you work your way through the SRA, you’ll only be asked questions that are relevant to your business based on your answers. In other words, how you respond to one question will determine the next set of questions you’ll receive. It’s designed to tailor the SRA specifically to your practice’s needs! 

We’ve also added a “Notes” section, as you can see here. Scenarios, where you might use the “Notes” feature, would include if you do something unique at your practice regarding a question or are in the process of mitigating a risk. Simply add that in the notes here while answering “Don’t Know”. The note will go directly into your final SRA and help show your documented culture of compliance. 

Finally, if you need to, feel free to press “Save and Exit” and you can return later to finish the process!
